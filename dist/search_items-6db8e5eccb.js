General acceptance criteria All code is in git repo (candidate can use his/her own github account). OTP application is a standard mix project. Application name is :ex_banking (main Elixir module is ExBanking). Application interface is just set of public functions of ExBanking module (no API endpoint, no REST / SOAP API, no TCP / UDP sockets, no any external network interface). Application should not use any database / disc storage. All needed data should be stored only in application memory. Candidate can use any Elixir or Erlang library he/she wants to (but app can be written in pure Elixir / Erlang / OTP). Solution will be tested using our auto-tests for this task. So, please follow specifications accurately. Public functions of ExBanking module described in this document is the only one thing tested by our auto-tests. If anything else needs to be called for normal application functioning then probably tests will fail. Code accuracy also matters. Readable, safe, refactorable code is a plus. Money amounts Money amount of any currency should not be negative. Application should provide 2 decimal precision of money amount for any currency. Amount of money incoming to the system should be equal to amount of money inside the system + amount of withdraws (money should not appear or disappear accidentally). User and currency type is any string. Case sensitive. New currencies / users can be added dynamically in runtime. In the application, there should be a special public function (described below) for creating users. Currencies should be created automatically (if needed).","ref":"ExBanking.html","title":"ExBanking","type":"module"},{"doc":"Function creates new user in the system New user has zero balance of any currency","ref":"ExBanking.html#create_user/1","title":"ExBanking.create_user/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"Increases user's balance in given currency by amount value Returns new_balance of the user in given format","ref":"ExBanking.html#deposit/3","title":"ExBanking.deposit/3","type":"function"},{"doc":"Returns balance of the user in given format","ref":"ExBanking.html#get_balance/2","title":"ExBanking.get_balance/2","type":"function"},{"doc":"Decreases from_user's balance in given currency by amount value Increases to_user's balance in given currency by amount value Returns balance of from_user and to_user in given format","ref":"ExBanking.html#send/4","title":"ExBanking.send/4","type":"function"},{"doc":"Decreases user's balance in given currency by amount value Returns new_balance of the user in given format","ref":"ExBanking.html#withdraw/3","title":"ExBanking.withdraw/3","type":"function"},{"doc":"Abstract some specific User and intra-user actions, just to clean up ExBanking's interface Could be a &quot;user context&quot; specific module but it is not needed to abstract more This also acts as a presentatin layer","ref":"ExBanking.Bank.html","title":"ExBanking.Bank","type":"module"},{"doc":"","ref":"ExBanking.Bank.html#create_user/1","title":"ExBanking.Bank.create_user/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"ExBanking.Bank.html#deposit/3","title":"ExBanking.Bank.deposit/3","type":"function"},{"doc":"Drop all users and queues.
